Performance testing 
---
jvisual ---bin path /..jdk 
here we can check the graph.


virtual user generator ----- called as vugen ----where test script are build
controller --running the script
analysis ---analyze the SLA


------
sessions -----starting to end--login to logout
in loadrunner min 50  virtual users can hit .

transactions ----each action. -----payment,mini statement,fund transfer
----payment---critical transaction


set of transactions  ---makes the test script.



response time ---is the  output ----SLA
if SLA are not met it is performance degradation
Defect in loadrunner is called bottleneck.


https--------->web service------>application server ------>DB

the  roundtrip is the  response time.
degradtion can  happen due to coding in webserve or app server or db
not using the  latest funcationlity like  hashmap ---ex

Post identifying the Bottleneck.
Use the Profiling tool to analyse the delay ---
webserve and appserver -----Profiling
Analysing DB is called Tuning



tEST ENVIRONMENT (load env) SHOULD BE  80% similar to PROD in performace testing.


Rammed testing 
so while checking  performace of an app for 2 hrs

/-\
30 min 1000 users increased by 100 and stable ---1 hr 
decrease 30 min

------------------------------------------

f12
network
record is enabled
200 ---response ok (302 --re-direct)
preview will have basic html
response ---code 

we can say its working based on basic html and response code

-----------
parameterize the  static values like username password
co-relation ----hadling the dynamic values like session id ---which gets changes every transaction in a session.
imp  concept --co-relation

---------------------------------

File --
category --
protocol ----------testing differnt app 
--select  web-http/html


----------------

once we logout ...2  resonse will come --302D and  200 ---THIS IS FINE .
logout is least prioirty
redirected page will have  code 200

---------------------

Naming standard ....
Page_criticaltransaction_date_info

JpetStore_Dogs_nov12_Baseline


baseline ----basic version(initial) of recording ..should be left untouched ...
will have version and  work on that.



------------------------

vuser_int -----this will contain launch and  login info 
action ---all the actions


Openruntime settings dialog box
html based script 
script containing explit url only

--------

runtime  settings

----run logic 

add the action..based on requirement and save
pacing ---delay between  each login

satrt new iteration fixed intervals,every 60 sec

it should be completed within 60 sec

think time -----manual .time delay ..
how much time taken by user to fill the form ..provide the time delay manually.
different ---
replay think time as recorded
multiplying the think time by 3
percentage of the time ---50 to 100  of 5 sec

-----------------
log ---records all the  responses.

log 
extended log
parameter substitution
include environment information ...
this is enabled only when we have issues....



------------------------------------------------
go to run settings give the browser ---
record
then 

start transaction 
end transaction
--------------
go to the harcoded value ---right click ..create parameter...
add column 
by name


select next row  ----unique
simulate parameter



---------------------------

record twice

1.baseline
2.baselinecompare

compare using beyond compare software or tools compare in vugen
identify the dynamic values.




--------------------
CO-RELATION
replacing the  dynamic value with parameter
---
identify the tag(boundary) for the dynamic value.
output --->code generation-->place the dynamic value and  identify the boundary.

---> check whether it is in response by searching for the  next $$$$
then --->.inf --->find the .inf

you can chek whether oundary is correct based on regular expression---
_csrf" value="(.*?)"/>    -------------> options regular expression


-----

web_reg_save_param("variablename","LB=","RB=",ORD=1",LAST);

web_reg_save_param("csrf_token","LB=_csrf\" value=\"","RB=\"/>", "ORD=1",LAST);


----scripts should run successfully.
